For this project, I will be visualizing different charities available for the public to donate to, and analyze the data using D3.js
There are many "non-profit" charities out there that spend majority of their funds not on charitable work but on administration, advertising, and CEO paychecks. I want to expose some charities that are famous to the public such as the Red Cross and American Cancer Society.

I hope to use the Charity Navigator API which would provide the data without manual work that may be incorrect as well as the D5.js to visualize the said data.
